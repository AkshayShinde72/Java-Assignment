Spring boot is a module of Spring from which we speed up the development.

It provides an easier and faster way to set up, configure and run both simple and web-based applications.
In spring boot we need to provide very less configuration but it doesn't mean we don't need to configure anything.

Spring boot = Spring framework + embedded server - configuration

That means when we use spring boot, we need less configuration as compare to that when we don't use spring boot.



The main goal of Spring Boot is to quickly create Spring-based applications without requiring developers to write the same boilerplate configuration again and again.

Advantages of Spring Boot

1) it creates stand-alone spring applications which can be started using java -jar.
		This jar file you need to just run. As soon as you run this jar file automatically server will get started and your application will be deployed on it.

2) Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly [ no need to deploy war files ]

3) Convention over Configuration software design style. [ it means Spring boot says that if you follow these conventions then I will do configurations for you ]
		It reduces efforts of the developers
Opinionated Default - Automatically configure
			This automatic configuration may work for us without doing anything or we may need to change it to some extent.
